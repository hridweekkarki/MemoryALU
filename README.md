# MemoryALU
Register Array & ALU System

Personal Project of an FPGA design implementation which consists of an ALU and a Register Array system along with other components that control the data flow from input to output/display. 

The design uses eight switches and four push buttons for input. It has an address register, which stores the destination register address into it beforehand along with a 7-segment display system. The 8-switch input is taken when one of the four pushbuttons is pressed and the command related to that particular pushbutton is implemented. The four pushbuttons of the current design are respectively: Load the Destination into Address Register, Load into the Register Array, Activate and Display ALU output, and Display from specific Register.
