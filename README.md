# MemoryALU
Register Array & ALU System

The design uses eight switches and four pushbuttons for input. It has an address register, which stores the destination register address into it beforehand and then an 8bit word would be loaded into that register. The switch input is taken again while pressing one of the fours pushbuttons. The four pushbuttons of the current design are respectively: Address Register, Load into the Register, Activate and Display ALU output, and Display from specific Register. The 8 switch input also has a lot of different formats to be used in.
